As described in the Playbook API documentation, this causes phantom.act() to run the action against all assets supporting that specific action. In this case all apps support 'test connectivity' so all assets will be used.\n\nDespite its simplicity this Playbook can take a long time to run and use system resources rather heavily when many assets are configured. Also, since some assets require additional steps in 'test connectivity' such as visiting a URL in a browser for OAuth2 authentication, the asset might still be usable despite a failure in this Playbook."
